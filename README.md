# xcomfort-node

Unofficial node library for communicating with Eaton xComfort bridge.
For now, this repository only contains a server application that can act as man-in-the-middle to spy on communication between a device(iOs/Android) and a xComfort Bridge.
For instructions on how to use it, [look here](mitm/README.md)

Plan is to expand this into an npm package to enable using xComfort bridge from Homey and other home automation servers.
Contributions welcome...
